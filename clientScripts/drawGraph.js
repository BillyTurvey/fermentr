		Thinking out loud...
		we need the array of time series thermal data to draw the graph. Easy enough to fetch.

		To draw the graph:
		- Work out the overal scale:
			- The x axis total length will vary depending on how much data has been collected. Perhaps it will be 110%? of the length of the data recorded. x = 0 = yeast pitch time || the first temp measurement
			- The data line should be in the middle of the y axis. 
				- The middle of the y axis should be the mean y value of all datapoints
			- The range of the data shown on the y axis is to be determined, try either 0-50â€¢C or the range of the y values +- 100-200% either side? 

		- Draw a rectangle to fill the alloted space on the page
			- Y max = y * 1.2

		- Problem: Data can not assumed to be equally distanced along the x axis, the device may have been unplugged for a short while or it may not have been able to connect to the wifi. Data are mostly one minute apart but not always.
			- grab the range in time and devide it by the number of pixels available in the x axis in the alloted area to get the time period that each pixel width on the x axis represents.
			- if there are more pixels than data then the 
			- for each pixel work out the mean of all the temps measured during that time period, this gives a new array of y values for each pixel.
