// If the fermentation doesn't have any temp data – actual or target – the graph will not be present on the page
// If the fermentation does have temp data – actual or target – the graph will be present on the page.
// page should load with a spinner? until the graph loads? there should be something.
// ASAP a fetch request should grap an overview of the fermentation's thermal profile to date AND the target thermal profile if it has one too
// if there's a thermal profile, the graph width should be the length of the planned fermentation length
// if the fermentation has no planned profile the width of the graph should be the width of the time elapsed
// the graph should be the full width of the useable screen
